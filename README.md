* ⚡ Fun fact: ...💡 Did you know?  The first website ever created is still online! In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, created the first website at CERN. You can still visit it [here](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).
As a web developer, I’m fascinated by how far we’ve come from those early days, and I'm excited to be part of the ever-evolving web landscape! 🚀
